# Spine Web JS client library
This module is a JS library that communicates with Spine Web server. Itâ€™s a facade for sending 
domain commands, querying data and subscribing to entity states.  

The latest published version can be found on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spine-web).

The NPM artifact:
* Provides `spine-web` files along with used Protobuf definitions.
* Provides types from [google-protobuf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-protobuf) NPM package.
 These types should be used since they are additionally processed by Spine's Protobuf plugin for JS.
* Provides sources transpiled into ES5 along with theirs source maps.
* Does **not** provide a bundled version assuming that a library user does bundling on its own.
